1) Shortcomings of array over linked list:

Arrays have a fixed size, which means they cannot dynamically resize themselves. Linked lists, on the other hand, can grow or shrink as needed.
Insertions and deletions in arrays can be inefficient, especially if elements need to be shifted. Linked lists allow for efficient insertions and deletions anywhere in the list.
Arrays require contiguous memory allocation, which may not always be available or practical. Linked lists can be implemented using non-contiguous memory allocation.
Searching for an element in an array requires linear time complexity for unsorted arrays and logarithmic time complexity for sorted arrays. In contrast, linked lists typically have linear time complexity for searching.


2) Linked List: Linear or Non-linear:

Linked lists are linear data structures because their elements are sequentially connected. Each element points to the next element in the sequence, forming a linear chain.


3) Explanation of Linked List:

A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements, called nodes, where each node contains a data field and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to null, indicating the end of the list. Linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertions and deletions, but slower access times compared to arrays.

4)Program to Reverse a Linked List:

class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    
    ListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class ReverseLinkedList {
    public static ListNode reverseLinkedList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            ListNode nextNode = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = nextNode;
        }
        return prev;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a linked list
        ListNode head = new ListNode(1);
        head.next = new ListNode(2);
        head.next.next = new ListNode(3);
        head.next.next.next = new ListNode(4);

        // Reverse the linked list
        head = reverseLinkedList(head);

        // Print the reversed linked list
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.print(current.val + " ");
            current = current.next;
        }
    }
}

5) Reverse Linked List using Single Pointer:

It's not possible to reverse a singly linked list using only one pointer. You need at least two pointers to reverse the direction of links.

6) Pointer Type for Heterogeneous Linked List in C:

    heterogeneous linked list in Java, you would simply use object references to represent the nodes in the list.


7) Detecting whether a Linked List is Linear or Circular:

To detect whether a linked list is linear or circular, you can use Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm). This algorithm involves moving two pointers at different speeds through the linked list. If the pointers meet at some point, the list is circular; otherwise, it's linear.

8) Program to Create Heterogeneous Linked List:

Here's a simple example of creating a heterogeneous linked list in C:
class Node {
    Object data;
    Node next;

    Node(Object data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

public class HeterogeneousLinkedList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Node head = null;

        // Add integer data
        head = addNode(head, 1);
        head = addNode(head, 2);
        head = addNode(head, 3);

        // Add string data
        head = addNode(head, "Hello");
        head = addNode(head, "World");

        // Print data in the linked list
        Node current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            System.out.println(current.data);
            current = current.next;
        }
    }

    public static Node addNode(Node head, Object data) {
        Node newNode = new Node(data);
        if (head == null) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node current = head;
            while (current.next != null) {
                current = current.next;
            }
            current.next = newNode;
        }
        return head;
    }
}

9) Finding the Address of the Middle Node in a Singly Linked List:

You can find the address of the middle node in a singly linked list using the "slow and fast pointer" technique. Traverse the list with two pointers, one advancing two nodes at a time (fast pointer) and the other advancing one node at a time (slow pointer). When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node.

10) Searching for Data in a Linked List:

To search for data in a linked list, traverse the list from the head node while comparing each node's data with the target data. If the data matches, return the node; otherwise, continue traversing until the end of the list or until the data is found.
